# Animal Guessing Game

The Animal Guessing Game is an engaging and educational app where the player must guess a randomly selected animal. 
It's perfect for group fun or individual entertainment, combining elements of learning and play.

## How the App Works

### Game Mechanics

- **Random Animal Selection**: The app randomly selects an animal from a database.
- **Player's Objective**: The human player must guess the animal.

### Player Options

- **Get Hint**: Players can request up to 10 hints per animal to help identify the animal.
- **Solve**: Players can attempt to solve up to 3 times per round to guess the animal correctly.

### Data and Hints

- **Extensive Animal Collection**: The app includes data for at least 50 different animals (and has an additional 50 predators).
- **Detailed Hints**: Each animal comes with 10 unique hints focusing on various characteristics like color, habitat, diet, and size.

### Gameplay

- **Multiple Guessing Rounds**: The game is designed to be entertaining with multiple rounds of guessing.
- **Scoring System**: Players earn points based on the number of hints and attempts used. Specifically, 
     a successful guess scores 13 - n - m points, where 'n' is the number of hints used, and 'm' is the number of guessing attempts.
- **Highscore List**: The app stores the results and displays them in a highscore list to track progress and compete with friends.
